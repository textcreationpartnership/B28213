            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <l>REtir'd within my self, thus long to mourn,</l>
               <l>Despairing of my former Joy's return;</l>
               <l>Confin'd to mournfull melancholly Thought,</l>
               <l>Whose Cause, excess of Grief alone has wrought,</l>
               <l>No Remedy to mitigate my Woe.</l>
               <l>Besides what Tears and deepest Sighs allow:</l>
               <l>Faign I from Words wou'd seek for some Relief,</l>
               <l>Desiring thence no Cure, but Ease from Grief:</l>
               <l>But oh! the Subject now becomes too great,</l>
               <l>For Sighs and Tears to show, or Words repeat.</l>
               <l>This fatal Truth does <hi>Albion</hi> now confess,</l>
               <l>And knows not how Her Sorrows to express;</l>
               <l>But for Heav'ns promise which prevents my Fears,</l>
               <l>I shou'd expect a second Flood by Tears.</l>
               <l>Time, which has ever yet been found to be,</l>
               <l>Against such Ills a Sovereign Remedy,</l>
               <l>Will useless now, and ineffectual prove,</l>
               <l>And must our selves, if it our Grief remove:</l>
               <l>For all till Death, must this great Loss deplore,</l>
               <l>When Time it self with us can be no more.</l>
               <l>For ever Sacred be Her Memory;</l>
               <l>From swift-pac'd Time's destructive Power free,</l>
               <l>'Till swallow'd with it in Eternity.</l>
               <l>What Blessings did we promise to our Isle?</l>
               <l>What blooming Hopes did adverse Fate beguile?</l>

               <l>Since that the Word was Flesh; sure Heav'n ne're joyn'd</l>
               <l>Such lovely Form, with so divine a Mind.</l>
               <l>Those ill Examples which in Courts abound,</l>

               <l>Caus'd on Her well fix'd Vertues no Restraint;</l>
               <l>Like Mercy kind, and Pious as a Saint.</l>
               <l>Ne're were in one so many Grace seen;</l>
               <l>Meek, tho' so Great, and Humble, tho' a Queen.</l>
               <l>Vice in a Torrent long o're-flow'd the Land,</l>
               <l>Which She alone was able to withstand:</l>
               <l>Nor onely so, but stemm'd th' increasing Flood,</l>
               <l>And show'd the Excellence of being Good.</l>
               <l>This She durst do, and do at such a Time,</l>
               <l>When Vice was hugg'd, and Vertue thought a Crime.</l>
               <l>Vertue felt an Eclipse till She appear'd;</l>
               <l>And scarce more than the Name was known or heard.</l>
               <l>What Vertues scatter'd through the Sex appear</l>
               <l>In Her, a glorious Constellation were.</l>
               <l>We now (since She from Care below's releas'd)</l>
               <l>May truly say, That Miracles are ceas'd.</l>
               <l>But say, Oh! Whither, whither is She fled?</l>
               <l>Methinks I hear Grief whisper, She is Dead.</l>
               <l>Oh! never say She's dead, can such Worth be</l>
               <l>Like us, subjected to Mortality?</l>
               <l>Say rather, On an Embassy She's gone,</l>
               <l>(As none so fit) to the Caelestial Throne,</l>
               <l>(As whilst on Earth we were Her chiefest Care,</l>
               <l>So now) to fix a firm Alliance there.</l>
